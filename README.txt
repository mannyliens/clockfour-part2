Front-end Dev Assessment (~2 hours)

Thanks for taking our assessment! Read this document thoroughly before you start.

1.	Build a responsive landing page based on the specs provided in this document. 
    The most important part of this task is that the finished landing page matches the design comps included as closely as possible. 
    Attention to detail in this area is key.

2.	A simple gulp-based dev environment has been provided. It provides a starting point and should be self-explanatory.

3.	You are free to use Bootstrap or a similar UI framework, and jQuery. Ideally, you would include these dependencies via NPM.

4.	You are not required to use a JavaScript framework like Angular or React. You can if you feel it’s necessary. 
    We have not configured the project that way however - remember item #1 is the most important thing and there is a time limit.

5.	Create your own git branch to work in – DO NOT work in the master branch. We suggest committing often and writing useful commit messages. 
    When you’re finished with the assessment, ideally all changes will be committed and no untracked files remain. There’s no need to push.

Included with this project are three images that you should use as your reference for styling the pages. 
They are located in the ‘reference’ folder. Note the 3 breakpoints:

•	768px and below should be a fluid layout – see breakpoint1.png for reference.
•	Between 769px and 1199px should layout as shown in breakpoint2.png
•	Layout for screens 1200px and above is shown in breakpoint3.png

There are no web fonts required. The screenshots provided were taken on a Mac in Chrome. You can use the following font-family stack: 
Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif

The Frequently Asked Questions section should be collapsed on page load, and expand when the header is clicked.

The section below contains the copy for the pages.

FAQ (simply repeat the text below a few times)

Earn 1 point for every eligible net $1 you spend.
Each month you will earn 1 point per net dollar spent on all your purchases. In addition, every month you will automatically receive a bonus equal to 25% of the total points you earned in that month from your net purchases. So, in total, you will earn 1.25 points for your net purchases, and you'll see the bonus portion of your monthly points total displayed separately in the rewards section of your monthly statement.
